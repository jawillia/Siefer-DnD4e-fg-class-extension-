# Siefer-DnD4e-fg-class-extension

The continuations of my DnD 4e extensions for Fantasy Grounds that add various capabilities from other rulesets that I want to see in the 4e one. This mostly includes creating other records and making them draggable onto the character sheet.



\#Release Notes  
v.0.1.0 - 10/05/2025 - Initial Release. Basic UI display of classes in sidebar, adds link to record in character sheet, and includes support for armor, weapon, and implement proficiencies, hit points at first level, max healing surges, and trained skills for classes when dragging class onto sheet.





What This Extension Does:



* Adds a record type for classes in the sidebar
* Allows you to drag a class record to a character in order to add that class to your character sheet
* Adds a link in the character sheet to your class and its associated record
* When a class record is dragged to your character sheet, it will automatically add armor, weapon, and implement proficiencies, hit points at first level, max healing surges, defense bonuses, and trained skills.





What This Extension Does Not Do (but it might do one day):



* It does not allow class support beyond first level.
* It does not add class features or powers yet.
* It doesn't support hybrid classes.
* It doesn't have a UI to add custom classes yet.
* It only supports base classes, not paragon classes or epic destinies.



















This extension adds a sidebar item for races to D\&D 4th edition, like in other rulesets, and adds a few automation capabilities related to that.
